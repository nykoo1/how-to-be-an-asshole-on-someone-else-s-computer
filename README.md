how to be an asshole on someone else's computer
===============================================

copy everything from this repo (excluding this readme)
onto a thumb drive (preferably a SanDisk (those seem
to work better / more efficiently))

then, stick the thumb drive into someone's computer
(running â‰¤ Windows 7) and wait for the magic to happen.
